# Git Commands to Commit and Push Your Polling App

## Initial Setup (if not done yet)

```bash
cd polling-app
git init
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
```

## Stage All Changes

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Or add specific directories if you prefer
git add app/ components/ lib/ types/ public/
git add package.json tsconfig.json next.config.ts
git add README.md SETUP_COMPLETE.md .gitignore
```

## Commit with Descriptive Message

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Complete polling app scaffolding with authentication and dashboard

- Fix duplicate folder structure issue
- Add authentication system with mock login/register
- Create comprehensive dashboard with statistics
- Implement poll management (create, list, detail pages)
- Add all Shadcn UI components (button, card, input, etc.)
- Create responsive layouts and navigation
- Add TypeScript types for all data structures
- Include mock data system ready for API integration
- Set up proper routing with Next.js app directory
- Add landing page with feature showcase

Ready for backend integration and further development"
```

## Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch (first time)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Or if you already have the branch set up
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Shorter Commit Message

If you prefer a shorter commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Complete polling app setup

- Authentication system with login/register
- Dashboard with statistics and poll management  
- All UI components and responsive design
- Mock data system ready for backend integration
- Fixed folder structure and routing issues"
```

## Verify Your Commit

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Check remote repository
git remote -v
```

## Create GitHub Repository (if needed)

If you haven't created the GitHub repository yet:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "polling-app"
3. Don't initialize with README (since you already have files)
4. Copy the repository URL
5. Use it in the remote add command above

## Branch Strategy (Optional)

If you want to use a development branch:

```bash
# Create and switch to development branch
git checkout -b develop

# Push development branch
git push -u origin develop

# Later, merge to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

## Notes

- Make sure you have a GitHub account and are logged in
- Replace `<your-github-repo-url>` with your actual repository URL
- The `.gitignore` file will automatically exclude `node_modules/` and other unnecessary files
- Your commit will include all the scaffolded polling app structure and components

Once pushed, your polling app will be available on GitHub for others to clone and contribute to!
