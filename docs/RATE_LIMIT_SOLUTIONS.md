## ‚è∞ **Wait Times**

| Attempts | Wait Time |
|----------|-----------|
| 3-5      | 15 minutes |
| 5-10     | 30 minutes |
| 10+      | 60+ minutes |

**Important:** The timer resets with each failed attempt, so STOP trying!

## ‚ùì **Why This Happens**

Rate limiting is a security feature that prevents:
- Brute force password attacks
- Account takeover attempts
- System abuse

It's triggered by:
- Multiple wrong passwords
- Rapid login attempts
- Automated scripts/bots
- Network connectivity issues causing retries

## üÜò **Still Can't Get In?**

1. **Wait the full 60 minutes** (set a timer!)
2. **Try the password reset** option
3. **Use a completely different device/network**
4. **Contact support** if issue persists after 2 hours

## üìß **Contact Information**

If none of these solutions work after waiting 2+ hours:
- Email: [Add your support email]
- Include: Your email address, browser type, approximate time of issue
- Don't include: Your password or sensitive information

## üîí **Prevent Future Rate Limiting**

- **Save passwords** in your browser or password manager
- **Use "Remember me"** option if available
- **Don't guess passwords** - use reset function instead
- **Avoid rapid-fire login attempts**
- **Keep browser updated** to prevent session issues

**Remember: Patience is key! Rate limits are temporary and reset automatically.**
